# Overview

As a software engineer I'm working on ways to implement important applications on platforms that allow the most useful tools to be available at a user's fingertips. Not every userful program should be on a mobile device, however, the tools that a user needs while they are away from a desktop are critical to have implemented as native mobile apps, preventing down-time and frustrating situations trying to use web-only applications from a handheld/mobile. 

{Provide a description of your app.  Describe how to use the app.}
The app, "Spotography" is a tool to assist photographers and various other professions that desire to log and track location data. It allows the user to add a new location to a list via a form field. Within the form they are able to use their device camera to take a picture of the location for future reference, add a description, as well as save the geo-location data so they can easily map their locations and return again in the future. 


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
