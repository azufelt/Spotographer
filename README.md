# Overview

Spotography is a tool to assist photographers and others that desire to log and track location data. It allows the user to add a new location to a list via a form field. Within the form they are able to use their device camera to take a picture of the location for future reference and add a description. In the future a geo-location tag will be saved, so the user can easily map their locations and return again in the future.
