# Overview

As a software engineer I'm working on ways to implement important applications on platforms that allow the most useful tools to be available at a user's fingertips. Not every userful program should be on a mobile device, however, the tools that a user needs while they are away from a desktop are critical to have implemented as native mobile apps, preventing down-time and frustrating situations trying to use web-only applications from a handheld/mobile. 


The app, "Spotography" is a tool to assist photographers and various other professions that desire to log and track location data. It allows the user to add a new location to a list via a form field. Within the form they are able to use their device camera to take a picture of the location for future reference, add a description, as well as save the geo-location data so they can easily map their locations and return again in the future. 


<table border="0">
   <tr>
      <td>
        <h2>Home Screen View</h2>
        <img src="/assets/spotographer_home.png" width="100">
     </td>
      <td>
        <h2>Location Detail View</h2>
        <img src="/assets/spotographer_location-details.png" width="100">
     </td>   
   </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <h2>Add Location View</h2>
      <img src="/assets/spotographer_add-location.png" width="100">
    </td>
     <td>
      <h2>Account screen</h2>
      <img src="/assets/spotographer_account-screen.png" width="100">
     </td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <h2>User Locations List View</h2>
         <p float="left">
            <img src="Spotographer/assets/spotographer_locations_list.png" width="100" />
         </p>
      </td>
      <td>
         <p float-"left">
            <div width="100"></div>
         </p>
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>
